# ChatGPT Clone with Next.js, Supabase, and TypeScript

## Overview

This project is a ChatGPT clone built using Next.js for the frontend, Supabase for backend services including authentication and database handling, and TypeScript for type safety.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Users can interact with a chat interface similar to ChatGPT, where they can input prompts and receive responses generated by an AI model.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled with multiple methods:
  - **Email/Password**: Users can sign up for a new account or log in with their email and password.
  - **Google OAuth**: Users can also authenticate using their Google accounts via OAuth.
- **Database Handling**: Supabase provides a backend database for storing chat history and user information. The database schema includes tables for messages, chats, and user authentication details.
- **Message History**: Chat messages are stored in a dedicated `messages` table in the database, allowing users to view their chat history.
- **Chat Management**: Chat sessions are managed through a `chats` table, which associates users with their respective chat sessions.
- **User Management**: User authentication and user details are managed using Supabase's built-in `auth.users` table.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js is a React framework used for building the frontend interface. It provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **Backend**: Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides authentication, database, and storage services. It offers real-time functionality and APIs to handle backend operations efficiently.
- **Authentication**: Supabase supports multiple authentication methods, including email/password authentication and OAuth providers like Google.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality by providing static typing and other advanced features.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure Supabase:
   - Sign up for a Supabase account and create a new project.
   - Set up authentication with email/password and enable Google OAuth.
   - Create necessary database tables (`messages` and `chats`).
5. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase-url>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase-anon-key>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-api-key>
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your Supabase project URL, anonymous key, and OpenAI API key.
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can:

- Sign up for a new account using email/password or log in with existing credentials.
- Authenticate using their Google accounts via Google OAuth.
- Interact with the chat interface by entering prompts and receiving AI-generated responses.
- View their chat history and previous interactions.
